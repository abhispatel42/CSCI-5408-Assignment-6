# CSCI-5408-Assignment-6

We are provided with a training and test dataset of 13 different languages organized in 6 groups. Each of the 6 groups contains closely related languages or language varieties. 
We are first provided a set of 20,000 instances per language (18,000 training + 2,000 development) in CSV format.<br/> Each instance is a full sentence extracted from journalistic corpora and written in one of the languages and tagged with the language group and country of origin. After one month we will release a test set containing 1,000 unidentified instances of each language to be classified according to the country of origin.<br/> 
We list below the 13 languages and 6 groups involved:<br/>
•	Group A (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian)<br/>
•	Group B (Indonesian, Malaysian)<br/>
•	Group C (Czech, Slovakian)<br/>
•	Group D (Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese)<br/>
•	Group E (Peninsular Spain, Argentine Spanish)<br/>
•	Group F (American English, British English)<br/>

We have trained the model using various classifiers like :<br/>
1) Random forest<br/>
2) Linear SVM<br/>
3) Logistic Regression<br/>
4) Decision tree<br/>
5) Gaussian NB<br/>
6) Bernoulli NB<br/>
